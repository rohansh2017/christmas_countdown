# christmas_countdown

A new Flutter project to learn the basics of Flutter, just in time for Christmas! I wanted to learn how to add text and create simple apps and did so by creating a simple Christmas counter. Run the project by using "flutter run", and enjoy counting down the days to everyone's favorite holiday!
